# liver vessel segmentation

There have 325 folders named as "Sample-xxx" with "xxx" ranges from "001" to "325", representing the 325 CT volumes. Each folder contains three types of data, i.e., the original abdominal image contains the raw Hu values with the name "Liver.nii", the mask of liver with the name "Liver-mask.nii" and the mask of vessels with the name "Liver-vessel-mask.nii". All the slices contained in each sample are stacked together, and the orders are the same across the three file types.
