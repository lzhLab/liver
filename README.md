This study present an elaborated large-volume and high-quality dataset containing liver raw images, liver masks and liver vessel masks; in addition, a bi-directional scaling algorithm having shallow down-scaling and deep up-scaling is proposed for fine-grained vessel segmentation.

# Dataset

The masked labels as well as the raw images created in this study, namely LVSD300, has been uploaded to the IEEE DataPort with DOI:10.21227/rwys-mk84 (URL: https://ieee-dataport.org/documents/liver-vessel).
